Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do tasks that are usually done by humans because they require human intelligence and discernment. Although there are no AIs that can perform the wide variety of tasks an ordinary human can do, some AIs can match humans in specific tasks.
Artificial intelligence is the process of creating machines that can think like humans, or at least mimic human behavior in some way. Data science is the application of techniques from statistics, mathematics, computer programming and other fields to solve real-world problems using information technology.
Narrow AI focuses on performing specific tasks with high precision and accuracy. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. General AI, which remains a theoretical concept, would be able to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across various domains, just like humans.
